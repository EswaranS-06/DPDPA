# UTL-02 - Smart metering & analytics

**Sector:** Energy, Utilities & Infrastructure | **Department:** Metering

## Typical activities (create one `processing_activity` per row that exists at the client)
1. Interval reads
2. Load analytics
3. Theft detection

| Dimension | Typical values |
|---|---|
| Data principals | Consumer |
| Data categories | behavioural, location, device_online |
| Systems | MDM/HES |
| Third parties | AMISP |
| Lawful basis (typical) | [[s7a]], [[consent]] |
| Engine flags | processor, decision_or_disclosure |
| Risk context | ai |

## Obligations likely triggered (beyond the always-on baseline)
Baseline: governance, security (R6), breach (R7), retention (R8), grievance (R14) and linked CERT-In duties apply to every activity.

## Discovery prompts
- Which of the activities above exist here, and are there others?
- Confirm the data fields against real forms and screens.
- Confirm every system (incl. Excel/WhatsApp) and every recipient.
- Check whether the lawful basis per purpose is really as typical.
- Check whether the flags hold, especially children, cross-border and processors.
